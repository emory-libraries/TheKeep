Session configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of `Release 1.0 - Min Items, part IV`_ the project default Session configuration is set to mark
cookies as secure.  To enable login over HTTP (e.g. when developing with Django's runserver),
you will need to override this in your ``localsettings.py``.  See the commented out example in
``localsettings.py.sample``.
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
