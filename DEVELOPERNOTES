Notes for Developers
--------------------

Session configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of `Release 1.0 - Min Items, part IV`_ the project default Session configuration is set to mark
cookies as secure.  To enable login over HTTP (e.g. when developing with Django's runserver),
you will need to override this in your ``localsettings.py``.  See the commented out example in
``localsettings.py.sample``::

    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False


Conversion to Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All original code and old branches are still located in the SVN repository
located `here <https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/digital_masters/>`_


Large File Upload Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setup NFS Mount::

    $ sudo apt-get install sshfs
    $ sudo addgroup USERNAME fusef
    $ sudo chmod 665 /etc/fuse.conf

Add the the following to `/etc/fuse.conf`::

    user_allow_other


Copy ``sshfsmount.sh`` and ``lfi_mount.sh`` to your ~/bin directory
Modify ``lfi_mount.sh`` and fill in the variables. You will have to ask for the tomcat password.::

    ./sshfsmount.sh -h <remote host> -m <mount point> -p <remote path> -r <your userid> -u tomcat


To create the mouont run::

    $ lfi_mount.sh
