Notes for Developers
--------------------

See also :ref:`APP_MANAGEMENT` for documentation on application
management tasks that occasionally need to be handled by developers.

Session configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of :ref:`Release1-0` the project default Session configuration is set to mark
cookies as secure.  To enable login over HTTP (e.g. when developing with
Django's runserver), you will need to override this in your
``localsettings.py``.  See the commented out example in
``localsettings.py.sample``::

    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False


Conversion to Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All original code and old branches are still available
the `SVN repository <https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/digital_masters/>`_.

Large File Upload Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The large file upload requires a shared network mount point between the
Django server and the Fedora server.  The easiest way to
simulate that for development is to use sshfs.

Setup SSHFS Mount::

    $ sudo apt-get install sshfs
    $ sudo addgroup USERNAME fusef
    $ sudo chmod 665 /etc/fuse.conf

Add the the following to `/etc/fuse.conf`::

    user_allow_other


Copy ``sshfsmount.sh`` and ``lfi_mount.sh`` to your ~/bin directory
Modify ``lfi_mount.sh`` and fill in the variables. You will have to ask for the tomcat password.::

    ./sshfsmount.sh -h <remote host> -m <mount point> -p <remote path> -r <your userid> -u tomcat


To create the mouont run::

    $ lfi_mount.sh
