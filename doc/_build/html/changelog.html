<h2>Release 1.1.0 - Metadata Migration<a class="headerlink" href="#release-1-1-0-metadata-migration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Migrate all metadata for audio files from the existing Digital Masters
database to the new system so that existing users can transition to
use the new system entirely in place of the old one for audio
metadata.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A system administrator can run a script that reads metadata from
audio records in the old database and generates clear logs of items
and metadata in the old system. Stakeholders can review this log to
identify changes needed in either the source data or the processing.</li>
<li>A system administrator can run the metadata log script to
transform and migrate legacy system data into reposited metadata in
the new system. (Logging “Dry run” functionality will still be
available with a command-line option.)</li>
<li>Metadata experts and archivists can view all migrated fields in the
audio edit interface so that they can verify it and copy it to new
fields.</li>
<li>Users will be able to view and find migrated Audio File metadata by
association with a Collection object, based on either the collection
number (if location is MARBL and if an MSS collection number is
assigned) or the location (unnumbered collections for MARBL, EU
Archives or Oxford) in the legacy system data.</li>
<li>A user can designate &#8220;trash&#8221; records in the old database that should
not be reposited in the new system, by including the word &#8220;delete&#8221;
(not case sensitive) in the title field. The migration script will
not create an object to migrate metadata to, and the transaction log
will record a special &#8220;delete&#8221; error condition.</li>
<li>Users will see legacy system filename identifiers on the audio item
edit page for migrated records (where audio files stored in the
repository would normally be available for listening), so that they
will be able to locate the audio files that are not yet available in
the repository. (Note that future milestones will migrate this audio
into the repository.)</li>
<li>Archivists can use the web interface to search for migrated metadata
using newly migrated critical file metadata.</li>
<li>Researchers at the MARBL A/V kiosk see migrated records once (and
only once) in the kiosk interface.</li>
<li>A curator can select &#8220;Vendor&#8221; and &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (non-LDAP identities)
from the list of Transfer Engineer choices.</li>
<li>A curator can record correct speed metadata for digitized
microcassettes.</li>
<li>Librarians and preservation specialists can see in the legacy
Digital Masters interface whether any particular record&#8217;s metadata
has been migrated to The Keep and into what PID for easy
verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this milestone includes updates to take advantage of
EULindexer functionality and use Solr for searching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Users who browse or search for collections receive their results in
under 1 second for a faster user experience and more efficient
workflow.</li>
<li>Users who browse or search for audio items receive their results in
under 1 second for a faster user experience and more efficient
workflow.</li>
<li>When MARBL Kiosk requests audio items feeds, it receives results in
under 1 second, so that iTunes can harvest available items without
timing out.</li>

<p>Changes and fixes to Min items I-III that were needed for an initial production release.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A curator will see a message, “Changes not saved,” if they attempt to save changes to a metadata record but the
changes are not saved because of validation errors.</li>
<li>When editing an audio file, drop-down selectors should default to blank, even when a nonblank selection is required.</li>
<li>When a user (staff or public) downloads a file, the filename given to the downloaded file (copy of archival
master, or derived use copy format) will be based on the &#8220;noid&#8221; part of the PID number.</li>
<li>When a user searches for audio items, the “Rights” field should search the numeric rt:accessStatus/&#64;code and should
be called “Rights code.”</li>
<li>A curator has an easy way (within a single-click or so) to find the most recently created items (new uploads) so
that they can easily perform initial metadata on them. (Reversing the current item default search, which
returns all items in chronological order, is expected to be an easy way to provide this.)</li>
<li>The Collection metadata edit form will make field labels and field contents visually distinct to the user by use of
different fonts, in the same way that the Audio File edit form does.</li>
<li>Users creating or editing Collection metadata will not be required to add a Name element. If a Name element is
created, adding a Role and/or Role term will be optional as well.</li>
<li>A curator will have sufficient room to input and view a fairly long title for an item.</li>
<li>A curator or archivist can select from revised rights access status codes (numeric),
displayed with mnemonic abbreviations.</li>
<li>A curator or archivist can add an &#8220;IP Note&#8221; field to Rights metadata.</li>
<li>An archivist can over-ride an access status code that would grant access to the public to digitized file through
the MARBL Kiosk, by selecting a checkbox in the form.  Checking the box will cause &#8220;Deny access&#8221; to appear in red
letters next to the field.</li>
<li>A curator can choose from revised selections for the Source Tech Housing field; new choices are jewel case;
plastic container; paper sleeve; cardboard sleeve; cardboard box; other; none.</li>
<li>A curator can choose from 2 additional selections for Source Technical - Reel Size: &#8220;not applicable&#8221;,
and &#8221; 4&#8221; &#8221; (four inches) and the field will no longer be required.</li>
<li>A curator can choose from revised selections for Source Technical - Recording Speed: aspect term &#8220;cylinder disk&#8221;
should be changed to &#8220;phono cylinder&#8221; in the drop-down list and in the metadata.</li>
<li>A curator will no longer be required to enter metadata in the Source Technical Sublocation field.</li>
<li>A curator will no longer be required to enter metadata in the Digital Technical  Digitization Purpose field.</li>
<li>The Digital Technical Transfer Engineer field will no longer be a required field (until non-LDAP choices are
available).</li>
<li>Change label for Collection search result column from MSS# to Col. No., to better reflect meaning for users.</li>
<li>Change label for Collection search result column from &#8220;Collection&#8221; to &#8220;Repository&#8221; to better reflect its revised
meaning.</li>
<li>In Collection search results, if there is no mods:title element (or it is empty) in a record retrieved by the
search, users will see “(no title present)” as a hyperlink to the record,  so that they can access the record
to add a title.</li>
<li>Metadata specialists and archivists will have access to links to view MODS, DC and RELS-EXT datastreams at
the top of the Collection metadata editing form so that they can view the XML for Collection objects.</li>
<li>When a user creates a new Collection object, the object will be available within a short time (less than 2 minutes)
in drop-down selections for the Audio Files Search by Collection and Audio Files Edit, Collection choice.</li>
