CHANGELOG
=========

Release 1.0 - Min Items, part IV
---------------------------------
Date: March 2011

Changes and fixes to Min items I-III that were needed for an initial production release.

* A curator will see a message, “Changes not saved,” if they attempt to save changes to a metadata record but the
  changes are not saved because of validation errors.
* When editing an audio file, drop-down selectors should default to blank, even when a nonblank selection is required.
* When a user (staff or public) downloads a file, the filename given to the downloaded file (copy of archival
  master, or derived use copy format) will be based on the "noid" part of the PID number.
* When a user searches for audio items, the “Rights” field should search the numeric rt:accessStatus/@code and should
  be called “Rights code.”
* A curator has an easy way (within a single-click or so) to find the most recently created items (new uploads) so
  that they can easily perform initial metadata on them. (Reversing the current item default search, which
  returns all items in chronological order, is expected to be an easy way to provide this.)
* The Collection metadata edit form will make field labels and field contents visually distinct to the user by use of
  different fonts, in the same way that the Audio File edit form does.
* Users creating or editing Collection metadata will not be required to add a Name element. If a Name element is
  created, adding a Role and/or Role term will be optional as well.
* A curator will have sufficient room to input and view a fairly long title for an item.
* A curator or archivist can select from revised rights access status codes (numeric),
  displayed with mnemonic abbreviations.
* A curator or archivist can add an "IP Note" field to Rights metadata.
* An archivist can over-ride an access status code that would grant access to the public to digitized file through
  the MARBL Kiosk, by selecting a checkbox in the form.  Checking the box will cause "Deny access" to appear in red
  letters next to the field.
* A curator can choose from revised selections for the Source Tech Housing field; new choices are jewel case;
  plastic container; paper sleeve; cardboard sleeve; cardboard box; other; none.
* A curator can choose from 2 additional selections for Source Technical - Reel Size: "not applicable",
  and " 4" " (four inches) and the field will no longer be required.
* A curator can choose from revised selections for Source Technical - Recording Speed: aspect term "cylinder disk"
  should be changed to "phono cylinder" in the drop-down list and in the metadata.
* A curator will no longer be required to enter metadata in the Source Technical Sublocation field.
* A curator will no longer be required to enter metadata in the Digital Technical  Digitization Purpose field.
* The Digital Technical Transfer Engineer field will no longer be a required field (until non-LDAP choices are
  available).
* Change label for Collection search result column from MSS# to Col. No., to better reflect meaning for users.
* Change label for Collection search result column from "Collection" to "Repository" to better reflect its revised
  meaning.
* In Collection search results, if there is no mods:title element (or it is empty) in a record retrieved by the
  search, users will see “(no title present)” as a hyperlink to the record,  so that they can access the record
  to add a title.
* Metadata specialists and archivists will have access to links to view MODS, DC and RELS-EXT datastreams at
  the top of the Collection metadata editing form so that they can view the XML for Collection objects.
* When a user creates a new Collection object, the object will be available within a short time (less than 2 minutes)
  in drop-down selections for the Audio Files Search by Collection and Audio Files Edit, Collection choice.
* A user can search for Audio Files by Date Uploaded in order to enable date-based report generation. The Audio Files
  input box for Date Captured should no longer appear to users, as it is no longer needed.

* A curator can use a web form to associate a digitized audio file with basic
  “stub” digital technical metadata.
* A curator can use a web form to associate a digitized audio file with basic
  “stub” rights metadata.

Release 0.8 - Min Items, part II
--------------------------------
Date: December 2010

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION RELEASE**

Minor enhancement to search functionality, use of ARKs for Fedora object pids,

  case sensitive and wildcard searching for both collection and item search.
* Web users can search for stub records by keyword, associated manuscript
  collection, and date created.
* Web users can select file records from search results to view or edit file
  metadata.
* A curator can use a web form to associate a digitized audio file with basic
  “stub” source technical metadata.

  5 seconds.



Release 0.7 - Min Items, part I
-------------------------------
Date: December 2010

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION RELEASE**

Support for audio file uploads and basic descriptive metadata for for newly
digitized sound recordings.

* A curator can ingest a batch of digitized audio files so that he doesn’t
  have to pause his workflow for several minutes for each one to upload
  individually.
* When a curator ingests audio files, additional metadata is generated from
  the file’s content and stored in reposited metadata to maintain accurate
  records.
* A curator can use a web form to associate a digitized audio file with
  basic “stub” descriptive metadata.
* A system administrator deploying the application can run a script to
  create a pre-selected list of collection objects based on the
  corresponding Finding Aids EAD XML for those collections.


Release 0.6
-------------
Date: October 2010

**NOT FOR RELEASE TO PRODUCTION**

Support for basic, production-ready user interface for adding and
managing the Fedora digital collection objects that will ultimately
contain digital master items.

* An editor can create a collection object, associate it with a
  top-level collection, and enter basic initial metadata, so that the
  collection can be described and assigned objects.
* An editor can edit complete initial metadata so that the collection
  MODS can describe the full range of available metadata.
* An editor can update descriptive metadata for a collection to keep
  collection metadata up-to-date.
* An editor can search for a collection by title, manuscript number,
  creator, and top-level collection to locate one for editing or to
  check if a particular collection exists before creating it.
* An editor can view a hierarchical list of collections to locate one
  for editing or to understand the organization of collections. 
* When any user creates or modifies a collection, the repository
  permanently associates that action with the user for preservation
  and auditing.
* When an editor saves changes on a collection, they can choose to
  continue editing or return to the default view.


Prototype ingest/editing
------------------------
Date: September 2010

**NOT FOR RELEASE TO PRODUCTION**

Prototype system that includes the simplest implementation of a
metadata editor interface and content ingest. This includes a simple
content model, ingest of a single sound file, and simple indexing, and
uses LDAP authentication for library staff.

  can be authorized if appropriate.
* Admins can assign roles and permissions to users to maintain
  security and workflow in the application. (built-in Django
  functionality)
* Editors can upload and ingest a sound file in wave format so
  metadata can be created for the ingest item.
* Editors can add or edit metadata to an ingested sound file from a
  selected mods subset to describe the sound file. 
* Editors can search ingested content by PID or Title so they can find
  an item to modify or create metadata. 
* Editors can download ingested audio files for review to assist them
  in creating metadata.  
* Editors receive error messages pertaining to metadata validation
  when editing records to ensure data quality and consistency. 
* The application logs and displays error messages related to
  interaction with Fedora for troubleshooting and communication. 
* Developers can create django forms related to XML objects to ease
  the development of editing interfaces.
* Developers can link an XML Object with an XML schema so objects can
  be validated.
