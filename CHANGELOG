Support for audio file uploads and basic descriptive metadata for for newly
digitized sound recordings.

* A curator can ingest a batch of digitized audio files so that he doesn’t
  have to pause his workflow for several minutes for each one to upload
  individually.
* When a curator ingests audio files, additional metadata is generated from
  the file’s content and stored in reposited metadata to maintain accurate
  records.
* A curator can use a web form to associate a digitized audio file with
  basic “stub” descriptive metadata.
* A system administrator deploying the application can run a script to
  create a pre-selected list of collection objects based on the
  corresponding Finding Aids EAD XML for those collections.


Release 0.6
-------------
Date: October 2010

**NOT FOR RELEASE TO PRODUCTION**

Support for basic, production-ready user interface for adding and
managing the Fedora digital collection objects that will ultimately
contain digital master items.

* An editor can create a collection object, associate it with a
  top-level collection, and enter basic initial metadata, so that the
  collection can be described and assigned objects.
* An editor can edit complete initial metadata so that the collection
  MODS can describe the full range of available metadata.
* An editor can update descriptive metadata for a collection to keep
  collection metadata up-to-date.
* An editor can search for a collection by title, manuscript number,
  creator, and top-level collection to locate one for editing or to
  check if a particular collection exists before creating it.
* An editor can view a hierarchical list of collections to locate one
  for editing or to understand the organization of collections. 
* When any user creates or modifies a collection, the repository
  permanently associates that action with the user for preservation
  and auditing.
* When an editor saves changes on a collection, they can choose to
  continue editing or return to the default view.


Prototype ingest/editing
------------------------
Date: September 2010

**NOT FOR RELEASE TO PRODUCTION**

Prototype system that includes the simplest implementation of a
metadata editor interface and content ingest. This includes a simple
content model, ingest of a single sound file, and simple indexing, and
uses LDAP authentication for library staff.

* Users can log into the application with their Emory User ID so they
  can be authorized if appropriate.
* Admins can assign roles and permissions to users to maintain
  security and workflow in the application. (built-in Django
  functionality)
* Editors can upload and ingest a sound file in wave format so
  metadata can be created for the ingest item.
* Editors can add or edit metadata to an ingested sound file from a
  selected mods subset to describe the sound file. 
* Editors can search ingested content by PID or Title so they can find
  an item to modify or create metadata. 
* Editors can download ingested audio files for review to assist them
  in creating metadata.  
* Editors receive error messages pertaining to metadata validation
  when editing records to ensure data quality and consistency. 
* The application logs and displays error messages related to
  interaction with Fedora for troubleshooting and communication. 
* Developers can create django forms related to XML objects to ease
  the development of editing interfaces.
* Developers can link an XML Object with an XML schema so objects can
  be validated.
