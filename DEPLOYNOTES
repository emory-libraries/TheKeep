Installation & Upgrade instructions
===================================

Release 0.7 - Min Items
-----------------------
* The new batch-upload/ingest process may result in uploaded files
  that will need to be cleaned up.  There is a custom manage.py script
  to handle this which should be configured to run as a cron job.
  This script relies on the following django settings:
  INGEST_STAGING_TEMP_DIR and INGEST_STAGING_KEEP_AGE.  If run with
  verbosity 0, only errors will be reported, i.e.::
     ``python manage.py  ingest_cleanup -v 0``
  NOTE: this script will delete all files older than a specified age
  in the configured directory, so it should **not** be run as a
  privileged user.
* Now requires access to eXist Database for the purpose of generating
  Fedora collection objects based on EAD Finding Aid documents.  All EXISTDB
  settings in the localsettings example file should be configured for access
  to an eXist 1.4.x instance with Finding Aids content.  It is recommended to
  configure eXist access using guest access or a non-privileged account.


Release 0.6
-------------
* Requires Fedora 3.4 or greater with LDAP login configured.
* Requires Fedora XACML policies (bundled with other local policies in
  https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/fedora/repository-policies/
* After django application and Fedora are both configured, run
  syncrepo to load Fedora fixtures and control objects::
  ``python manage.py syncrepo``
