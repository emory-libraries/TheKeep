Test Setup

Certain unit tests pass test user credentials to Fedora, in order to test and 
simulate accessing Fedora as the logged in user.  For tests to work properly,
the unit test user should be defined (with appropriate permissions)
as a fedora account.  See digitalmasters.audio.tests for account details.
